## Installation

In order to ensure compatibility and stability, this project uses specific versions of libraries, tailored for Python version `3.9.12`. Given the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI frameworks, this version locking helps maintain a consistent and error-free environment.

There is a [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file that contains all of the dependencies for the project. To install them, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you would prefer to use a virtual environment, you can create one with the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then, activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I couldn't have done it without you.\\n\\nGARRICK: (nodding) Likewise, Elara. Your archery skills are unmatched, and your connection with nature is truly a gift.\\n\\nARIA: (playfully) And I have to say, Elara, your arrows weakening the sorcerer's barrier really came in handy. I was finally able to strike.\\n\\nELARA: (smiling) It was a team effort. We complemented each other's strengths perfectly.\\n\\nGARRICK: (looking at Aria) And Aria, your stealth and knowledge of the underworld were invaluable. You were like a shadow, striking when it mattered most.\\n\\nARIA: (grinning) Thank you, Garrick. I've learned a thing or two about survival on the streets of Aranthia.\\n\\nELARA: (serious) But our journey is not yet over. There are still threats that loom over Eldoria, and we must remain vigilant.\\n\\nGARRICK: (determined) Agreed, Elara. We have proven ourselves as a formidable team, and together, we will face whatever challenges come our way.\\n\\nARIA: (nodding) Count me in. I've seen the corruption in this world, and I won't rest until justice is served.\\n\\n(They raise their weapons once more, a symbol of their unity and determination.)\\n\\nELARA: (raising her bow) For Eldoria!\\n\\nGARRICK: (raising his hands, crackling with lightning) For the power of nature!\\n\\nARIA: (brandishing her dagger) For justice and a better world!\\n\\n(With their spirits high, they exit the ancient temple, ready to face whatever lies ahead. Together, Elara, Garrick, and Aria will continue to protect Eldoria and ensure its restoration and prosperity.)\\n\\nEND OF SCENE 29\",\n",

Their name and structure are inspired by the\\\\nhuman brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.\\\\n\\\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing\\\\nan input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or\\\\nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and\\\\nthreshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified\\\\nthreshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the\\\\nnetwork. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.\\\\n\\\\nNeural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over\\\\ntime. However, once these learning algorithms are fine-tuned for accuracy,\\\\nthey are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence,\\\\nallowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech\\\\nrecognition or image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared\\\\nto the manual identification by human experts. One of the most well-known\\\\nneural networks is Google’s search algorithm.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nwatsonx at the US Open\\\\n\\\\nThe USTA partnered with IBM to add AI-generated commentary – built with\\\\nwatsonx and a custom large language model – to match highlights in the US Open\\\\napp.\\\\n\\\\nRelated content\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe to the IBM newsletter\\\\n\\\\n##  How do neural networks work?\\\\n\\\\nThink of each individual node as its own linear regression model, composed of\\\\ninput data, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. The formula would\\\\nlook something like this:\\\\n\\\\n∑wixi + bias = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + bias\\\\n\\\\noutput = f(x) = 1 if ∑w1x1 + b>= 0; 0 if ∑w1x1 + b < 0\\\\n\\\\nOnce an input layer is determined, weights are assigned. These weights help\\\\ndetermine the importance of any given variable, with larger ones contributing\\\\nmore significantly to the output compared to other inputs. All inputs are then\\\\nmultiplied by their respective weights and then summed. Afterward, the output\\\\nis passed through an activation function, which determines the output. If that\\\\noutput exceeds a given threshold, it “fires” (or activates) the node, passing\\\\ndata to the next layer in the network. This results in the output of one node\\\\nbecoming in the input of the next node. This process of passing data from one\\\\nlayer to the next layer defines this neural network as a feedforward network.\\\\n\\\\nLet’s break down what one single node might look like using binary values. We\\\\ncan apply this concept to a more tangible example, like whether you should go\\\\nsurfing (Yes: 1, No: 0). The decision to go or not to go is our predicted\\\\noutcome, or y-hat. Let’s assume that there are three factors influencing your\\\\ndecision-making:', metadata={'source': 'https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks'}), Document(page_content='Neural networks, as used in artificial intelligence, have traditionally been\\\\nviewed as simplified models of neural processing in the brain, even though the\\\\nrelation between this model and brain biological architecture is debated, as\\\\nit is not clear to what degree artificial neural networks mirror brain\\\\nfunction.[34]\\\\n\\\\n## Artificial intelligence[edit]\\\\n\\\\nMain article: Artificial neural network\\\\n\\\\nA _neural network_ (NN), in the case of artificial neurons called _artificial\\\\nneural network_ (ANN) or _simulated neural network_ (SNN), is an\\\\ninterconnected group of natural or artificial neurons that uses a mathematical\\\\nor computational model for information processing based on a connectionistic\\\\napproach to computation. In most cases, an ANN is an adaptive system that\\\\nchanges its structure based on external or internal information that flows\\\\nthrough the network.\\\\n\\\\nIn more practical terms neural networks are non-linear statistical data\\\\nmodeling or decision making tools. They can be used to model complex\\\\nrelationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.\\\\n\\\\nAn artificial neural network involves a network of simple processing elements\\\\n(artificial neurons) which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by\\\\nthe connections between the processing elements and element parameters.\\\\nArtificial neurons were first proposed in 1943 by Warren McCulloch, a\\\\nneurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, who first collaborated at the\\\\nUniversity of Chicago.[35]\\\\n\\\\nOne classical type of artificial neural network is the recurrent Hopfield\\\\nnetwork.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by Alan\\\\nTuring in his 1948 paper _Intelligent Machinery_ in which he called them\\\\n\\\"B-type unorganised machines\\\".[36]\\\\n\\\\nThe utility of artificial neural network models lies in the fact that they can\\\\nbe used to infer a function from observations and also to use it. Unsupervised\\\\nneural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that\\\\ncapture the salient characteristics of the input distribution, e.g., see the\\\\nBoltzmann machine (1983), and more recently, deep learning algorithms, which\\\\ncan implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data. Learning\\\\nin neural networks is particularly useful in applications where the complexity\\\\nof the data or task makes the design of such functions by hand impractical.\\\\n\\\\n## Applications[edit]\\\\n\\\\nNeural networks can be used in different fields. The tasks to which artificial\\\\nneural networks are applied tend to fall within the following broad\\\\ncategories:\\\\n\\\\n  * Function approximation, or regression analysis, including time series prediction and modeling.\\\\n  * Classification, including pattern and sequence recognition, novelty detection and sequential decision making.\\\\n  * Data processing, including filtering, clustering, blind signal separation and compression.\\\\n\\\\nApplication areas of ANNs include nonlinear system identification[37] and\\\\ncontrol (vehicle control, process control), game-playing and decision making\\\\n(backgammon, chess, racing), pattern recognition (radar systems, face\\\\nidentification, object recognition), sequence recognition (gesture, speech,\\\\nhandwritten text recognition), medical diagnosis, financial applications, data\\\\nmining (or knowledge discovery in databases, \\\"KDD\\\"), visualization and e-mail\\\\nspam filtering. For example, it is possible to create a semantic profile of\\\\nuser\\\\'s interests emerging from pictures trained for object recognition.[38]\\\\n\\\\n## Neuroscience[edit]\\\\n\\\\nTheoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the\\\\nanalysis and computational modeling of biological neural systems. Since neural\\\\nsystems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behaviour, the field\\\\nis closely related to cognitive and behavioural modeling.', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network'}), Document(page_content='Neural nets were a major area of research in both neuroscience and computer\\\\nscience until 1969, when, according to computer science lore, they were killed\\\\noff by the MIT mathematicians Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, who a year\\\\nlater would become co-directors of the new MIT Artificial Intelligence\\\\nLaboratory.\\\\n\\\\nThe technique then enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s, fell into eclipse again\\\\nin the first decade of the new century, and has returned like gangbusters in\\\\nthe second, fueled largely by the increased processing power of graphics\\\\nchips.\\\\n\\\\n“There’s this idea that ideas in science are a bit like epidemics of viruses,”\\\\nsays Tomaso Poggio, the Eugene McDermott Professor of Brain and Cognitive\\\\nSciences at MIT, an investigator at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain\\\\nResearch, and director of MIT’s Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines. “There\\\\nare apparently five or six basic strains of flu viruses, and apparently each\\\\none comes back with a period of around 25 years. People get infected, and they\\\\ndevelop an immune response, and so they don’t get infected for the next 25\\\\nyears. And then there is a new generation that is ready to be infected by the\\\\nsame strain of virus. In science, people fall in love with an idea, get\\\\nexcited about it, hammer it to death, and then get immunized — they get tired\\\\nof it. So ideas should have the same kind of periodicity!”\\\\n\\\\n **Weighty matters**\\\\n\\\\nNeural nets are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns\\\\nto perform some task by analyzing training examples. Usually, the examples\\\\nhave been hand-labeled in advance. An object recognition system, for instance,\\\\nmight be fed thousands of labeled images of cars, houses, coffee cups, and so\\\\non, and it would find visual patterns in the images that consistently\\\\ncorrelate with particular labels.\\\\n\\\\nModeled loosely on the human brain, a neural net consists of thousands or even\\\\nmillions of simple processing nodes that are densely interconnected. Most of\\\\ntoday’s neural nets are organized into layers of nodes, and they’re “feed-\\\\nforward,” meaning that data moves through them in only one direction. An\\\\nindividual node might be connected to several nodes in the layer beneath it,\\\\nfrom which it receives data, and several nodes in the layer above it, to which\\\\nit sends data.\\\\n\\\\nTo each of its incoming connections, a node will assign a number known as a\\\\n“weight.” When the network is active, the node receives a different data item\\\\n— a different number — over each of its connections and multiplies it by the\\\\nassociated weight. It then adds the resulting products together, yielding a\\\\nsingle number. If that number is below a threshold value, the node passes no\\\\ndata to the next layer. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node\\\\n“fires,” which in today’s neural nets generally means sending the number — the\\\\nsum of the weighted inputs — along all its outgoing connections.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a neural net is being trained, all of its weights and thresholds are\\\\ninitially set to random values. Training data is fed to the bottom layer — the\\\\ninput layer — and it passes through the succeeding layers, getting multiplied\\\\nand added together in complex ways, until it finally arrives, radically\\\\ntransformed, at the output layer. During training, the weights and thresholds\\\\nare continually adjusted until training data with the same labels consistently\\\\nyield similar outputs.\\\\n\\\\n **Minds and machines**', metadata={'source': 'https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414'}), Document(page_content='Edit links\\\\n\\\\n  * Article\\\\n  * Talk\\\\n\\\\nEnglish\\\\n\\\\n  * Read\\\\n  * Edit\\\\n  * View history\\\\n\\\\nTools\\\\n\\\\nTools\\\\n\\\\nmove to sidebar hide\\\\n\\\\nActions\\\\n\\\\n  * Read\\\\n  * Edit\\\\n  * View history\\\\n\\\\nGeneral\\\\n\\\\n  * What links here\\\\n  * Related changes\\\\n  * Upload file\\\\n  * Special pages\\\\n  * Permanent link\\\\n  * Page information\\\\n  * Cite this page\\\\n  * Wikidata item\\\\n  * Edit interlanguage links\\\\n\\\\nPrint/export\\\\n\\\\n  * Download as PDF\\\\n  * Printable version\\\\n\\\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\\\n\\\\nStructure in biology and artificial intelligence\\\\n\\\\nFor other uses, see Neural network (disambiguation).\\\\n\\\\nSimplified view of a feedforward artificial neural network\\\\n\\\\nA **neural network** can refer to _either_ a neural circuit of biological\\\\nneurons (sometimes also called a _biological neural network_ ), _or_ a network\\\\nof artificial neurons or nodes in the case of an artificial neural network.[1]\\\\nArtificial neural networks are used for solving artificial intelligence (AI)\\\\nproblems; they model connections of biological neurons as weights between\\\\nnodes. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative\\\\nvalues mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and\\\\nsummed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an\\\\nactivation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an\\\\nacceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and\\\\n1.\\\\n\\\\nThese artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive\\\\ncontrol and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-\\\\nlearning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive\\\\nconclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.[2]\\\\n\\\\n## Overview[edit]\\\\n\\\\nA biological neural network is composed of a group of chemically connected or\\\\nfunctionally associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many\\\\nother neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may\\\\nbe extensive. Connections, called synapses, are usually formed from axons to\\\\ndendrites, though dendrodendritic synapses[3] and other connections are\\\\npossible. Apart from electrical signalling, there are other forms of\\\\nsignalling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion.\\\\n\\\\nArtificial intelligence, cognitive modelling, and neural networks are\\\\ninformation processing paradigms inspired by how biological neural systems\\\\nprocess data. Artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling try to simulate\\\\nsome properties of biological neural networks. In the artificial intelligence\\\\nfield, artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to speech\\\\nrecognition, image analysis and adaptive control, in order to construct\\\\nsoftware agents (in computer and video games) or autonomous robots.\\\\n\\\\nHistorically, digital computers evolved from the von Neumann model, and\\\\noperate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a\\\\nnumber of processors. On the other hand, the origins of neural networks are\\\\nbased on efforts to model information processing in biological systems. Unlike\\\\nthe von Neumann model, neural network computing does not separate memory and\\\\nprocessing.\\\\n\\\\nNeural network theory has served to identify better how the neurons in the\\\\nbrain function and provide the basis for efforts to create artificial\\\\nintelligence.\\\\n\\\\n## History[edit]\\\\n\\\\nThe preliminary theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was\\\\nindependently proposed by Alexander Bain[4] (1873) and William James[5]\\\\n(1890). In their work, both thoughts and body activity resulted from\\\\ninteractions among neurons within the brain.\\\\n\\\\nComputer simulation of the branching architecture of the dendrites of\\\\npyramidal neurons.[6]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network'})].\\n            If the relevant documents are not useful, you can ignore them.\\n            --- \\n            Here are the relevant insights that we gathered from our interview questions and answers: [{'question': 'Can you explain the concept of neural networks and how they mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks are computational models inspired by the brain's network of neurons, designed to recognize patterns and make decisions. In both biological neurons and artificial neural units, an incoming signal is processed and passed on to connected units if it exceeds a certain threshold. The strength of the connections, known as weights, can be adjusted in the learning process to improve the network's performance.\\\"}, {'question': 'What are the different layers in a neural network and how do they contribute to its functioning?', 'answer': 'A typical neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the raw data and passes it to the hidden layers, where each layer progressively refines the information through a series of weighted connections and activation functions. The output layer produces the final prediction or classification, synthesizing the feature extraction and transformations performed by the preceding layers.'}, {'question': 'How do neural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks learn from training data by adjusting the weights of their connections to minimize the difference between their predicted output and the actual target values. During training, each pass through the entire dataset, known as an epoch, refines these weights based on a loss function that measures the error. Over time, this iterative process improves the network's performance, enabling it to make more accurate predictions or classifications.\\\"}, {'question': 'Can you provide examples of the applications of neural networks in computer science and artificial intelligence?', 'answer': 'Certainly! In computer vision, neural networks are used for tasks like object detection and facial recognition. In natural language processing, they power machine translation services and chatbots. Neural networks are also critical in autonomous vehicles for navigation, and in healthcare, they assist in diagnosing diseases through medical imaging.'}, {'question': 'What are some key milestones in the history of neural networks and their development?', 'answer': '1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduce a mathematical model of a neuron, laying the groundwork for neural networks. 1958: Frank Rosenblatt invents the Perceptron, an early neural network model that could learn simple tasks. 1986: Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams introduce backpropagation, significantly improving the training of multi-layer neural networks. 1990s: The vanishing gradient problem is identified, hindering the training of deep neural networks. Early 2000s: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revolutionize computer vision tasks. 2012: AlexNet, a deep CNN, wins the ImageNet competition, reinvigorating interest in neural networks. 2014-2016: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks become popular for sequence-based tasks like natural language processing. 2015: Residual Networks (ResNets) introduced, allowing for the training of even deeper networks. 2018-2021: Transformers and attention mechanisms become the state-of-the-art architecture for various tasks in machine learning and AI.

Their name and structure are inspired by the\\\\nhuman brain, mimicking the way that biological neurons signal to one another.\\\\n\\\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are comprised of a node layers, containing\\\\nan input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or\\\\nartificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and\\\\nthreshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified\\\\nthreshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the\\\\nnetwork. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.\\\\n\\\\nNeural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over\\\\ntime. However, once these learning algorithms are fine-tuned for accuracy,\\\\nthey are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence,\\\\nallowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech\\\\nrecognition or image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared\\\\nto the manual identification by human experts. One of the most well-known\\\\nneural networks is Google’s search algorithm.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nwatsonx at the US Open\\\\n\\\\nThe USTA partnered with IBM to add AI-generated commentary – built with\\\\nwatsonx and a custom large language model – to match highlights in the US Open\\\\napp.\\\\n\\\\nRelated content\\\\n\\\\nSubscribe to the IBM newsletter\\\\n\\\\n##  How do neural networks work?\\\\n\\\\nThink of each individual node as its own linear regression model, composed of\\\\ninput data, weights, a bias (or threshold), and an output. The formula would\\\\nlook something like this:\\\\n\\\\n∑wixi + bias = w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3 + bias\\\\n\\\\noutput = f(x) = 1 if ∑w1x1 + b>= 0; 0 if ∑w1x1 + b < 0\\\\n\\\\nOnce an input layer is determined, weights are assigned. These weights help\\\\ndetermine the importance of any given variable, with larger ones contributing\\\\nmore significantly to the output compared to other inputs. All inputs are then\\\\nmultiplied by their respective weights and then summed. Afterward, the output\\\\nis passed through an activation function, which determines the output. If that\\\\noutput exceeds a given threshold, it “fires” (or activates) the node, passing\\\\ndata to the next layer in the network. This results in the output of one node\\\\nbecoming in the input of the next node. This process of passing data from one\\\\nlayer to the next layer defines this neural network as a feedforward network.\\\\n\\\\nLet’s break down what one single node might look like using binary values. We\\\\ncan apply this concept to a more tangible example, like whether you should go\\\\nsurfing (Yes: 1, No: 0). The decision to go or not to go is our predicted\\\\noutcome, or y-hat. Let’s assume that there are three factors influencing your\\\\ndecision-making:', metadata={'source': 'https://www.ibm.com/topics/neural-networks'}), Document(page_content='Neural networks, as used in artificial intelligence, have traditionally been\\\\nviewed as simplified models of neural processing in the brain, even though the\\\\nrelation between this model and brain biological architecture is debated, as\\\\nit is not clear to what degree artificial neural networks mirror brain\\\\nfunction.[34]\\\\n\\\\n## Artificial intelligence[edit]\\\\n\\\\nMain article: Artificial neural network\\\\n\\\\nA _neural network_ (NN), in the case of artificial neurons called _artificial\\\\nneural network_ (ANN) or _simulated neural network_ (SNN), is an\\\\ninterconnected group of natural or artificial neurons that uses a mathematical\\\\nor computational model for information processing based on a connectionistic\\\\napproach to computation. In most cases, an ANN is an adaptive system that\\\\nchanges its structure based on external or internal information that flows\\\\nthrough the network.\\\\n\\\\nIn more practical terms neural networks are non-linear statistical data\\\\nmodeling or decision making tools. They can be used to model complex\\\\nrelationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.\\\\n\\\\nAn artificial neural network involves a network of simple processing elements\\\\n(artificial neurons) which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by\\\\nthe connections between the processing elements and element parameters.\\\\nArtificial neurons were first proposed in 1943 by Warren McCulloch, a\\\\nneurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, who first collaborated at the\\\\nUniversity of Chicago.[35]\\\\n\\\\nOne classical type of artificial neural network is the recurrent Hopfield\\\\nnetwork.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by Alan\\\\nTuring in his 1948 paper _Intelligent Machinery_ in which he called them\\\\n\\\"B-type unorganised machines\\\".[36]\\\\n\\\\nThe utility of artificial neural network models lies in the fact that they can\\\\nbe used to infer a function from observations and also to use it. Unsupervised\\\\nneural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that\\\\ncapture the salient characteristics of the input distribution, e.g., see the\\\\nBoltzmann machine (1983), and more recently, deep learning algorithms, which\\\\ncan implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data. Learning\\\\nin neural networks is particularly useful in applications where the complexity\\\\nof the data or task makes the design of such functions by hand impractical.\\\\n\\\\n## Applications[edit]\\\\n\\\\nNeural networks can be used in different fields. The tasks to which artificial\\\\nneural networks are applied tend to fall within the following broad\\\\ncategories:\\\\n\\\\n  * Function approximation, or regression analysis, including time series prediction and modeling.\\\\n  * Classification, including pattern and sequence recognition, novelty detection and sequential decision making.\\\\n  * Data processing, including filtering, clustering, blind signal separation and compression.\\\\n\\\\nApplication areas of ANNs include nonlinear system identification[37] and\\\\ncontrol (vehicle control, process control), game-playing and decision making\\\\n(backgammon, chess, racing), pattern recognition (radar systems, face\\\\nidentification, object recognition), sequence recognition (gesture, speech,\\\\nhandwritten text recognition), medical diagnosis, financial applications, data\\\\nmining (or knowledge discovery in databases, \\\"KDD\\\"), visualization and e-mail\\\\nspam filtering. For example, it is possible to create a semantic profile of\\\\nuser\\\\'s interests emerging from pictures trained for object recognition.[38]\\\\n\\\\n## Neuroscience[edit]\\\\n\\\\nTheoretical and computational neuroscience is the field concerned with the\\\\nanalysis and computational modeling of biological neural systems. Since neural\\\\nsystems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behaviour, the field\\\\nis closely related to cognitive and behavioural modeling.', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network'}), Document(page_content='Neural nets were a major area of research in both neuroscience and computer\\\\nscience until 1969, when, according to computer science lore, they were killed\\\\noff by the MIT mathematicians Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert, who a year\\\\nlater would become co-directors of the new MIT Artificial Intelligence\\\\nLaboratory.\\\\n\\\\nThe technique then enjoyed a resurgence in the 1980s, fell into eclipse again\\\\nin the first decade of the new century, and has returned like gangbusters in\\\\nthe second, fueled largely by the increased processing power of graphics\\\\nchips.\\\\n\\\\n“There’s this idea that ideas in science are a bit like epidemics of viruses,”\\\\nsays Tomaso Poggio, the Eugene McDermott Professor of Brain and Cognitive\\\\nSciences at MIT, an investigator at MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain\\\\nResearch, and director of MIT’s Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines. “There\\\\nare apparently five or six basic strains of flu viruses, and apparently each\\\\none comes back with a period of around 25 years. People get infected, and they\\\\ndevelop an immune response, and so they don’t get infected for the next 25\\\\nyears. And then there is a new generation that is ready to be infected by the\\\\nsame strain of virus. In science, people fall in love with an idea, get\\\\nexcited about it, hammer it to death, and then get immunized — they get tired\\\\nof it. So ideas should have the same kind of periodicity!”\\\\n\\\\n **Weighty matters**\\\\n\\\\nNeural nets are a means of doing machine learning, in which a computer learns\\\\nto perform some task by analyzing training examples. Usually, the examples\\\\nhave been hand-labeled in advance. An object recognition system, for instance,\\\\nmight be fed thousands of labeled images of cars, houses, coffee cups, and so\\\\non, and it would find visual patterns in the images that consistently\\\\ncorrelate with particular labels.\\\\n\\\\nModeled loosely on the human brain, a neural net consists of thousands or even\\\\nmillions of simple processing nodes that are densely interconnected. Most of\\\\ntoday’s neural nets are organized into layers of nodes, and they’re “feed-\\\\nforward,” meaning that data moves through them in only one direction. An\\\\nindividual node might be connected to several nodes in the layer beneath it,\\\\nfrom which it receives data, and several nodes in the layer above it, to which\\\\nit sends data.\\\\n\\\\nTo each of its incoming connections, a node will assign a number known as a\\\\n“weight.” When the network is active, the node receives a different data item\\\\n— a different number — over each of its connections and multiplies it by the\\\\nassociated weight. It then adds the resulting products together, yielding a\\\\nsingle number. If that number is below a threshold value, the node passes no\\\\ndata to the next layer. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node\\\\n“fires,” which in today’s neural nets generally means sending the number — the\\\\nsum of the weighted inputs — along all its outgoing connections.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a neural net is being trained, all of its weights and thresholds are\\\\ninitially set to random values. Training data is fed to the bottom layer — the\\\\ninput layer — and it passes through the succeeding layers, getting multiplied\\\\nand added together in complex ways, until it finally arrives, radically\\\\ntransformed, at the output layer. During training, the weights and thresholds\\\\nare continually adjusted until training data with the same labels consistently\\\\nyield similar outputs.\\\\n\\\\n **Minds and machines**', metadata={'source': 'https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414'}), Document(page_content='Edit links\\\\n\\\\n  * Article\\\\n  * Talk\\\\n\\\\nEnglish\\\\n\\\\n  * Read\\\\n  * Edit\\\\n  * View history\\\\n\\\\nTools\\\\n\\\\nTools\\\\n\\\\nmove to sidebar hide\\\\n\\\\nActions\\\\n\\\\n  * Read\\\\n  * Edit\\\\n  * View history\\\\n\\\\nGeneral\\\\n\\\\n  * What links here\\\\n  * Related changes\\\\n  * Upload file\\\\n  * Special pages\\\\n  * Permanent link\\\\n  * Page information\\\\n  * Cite this page\\\\n  * Wikidata item\\\\n  * Edit interlanguage links\\\\n\\\\nPrint/export\\\\n\\\\n  * Download as PDF\\\\n  * Printable version\\\\n\\\\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\\\n\\\\nStructure in biology and artificial intelligence\\\\n\\\\nFor other uses, see Neural network (disambiguation).\\\\n\\\\nSimplified view of a feedforward artificial neural network\\\\n\\\\nA **neural network** can refer to _either_ a neural circuit of biological\\\\nneurons (sometimes also called a _biological neural network_ ), _or_ a network\\\\nof artificial neurons or nodes in the case of an artificial neural network.[1]\\\\nArtificial neural networks are used for solving artificial intelligence (AI)\\\\nproblems; they model connections of biological neurons as weights between\\\\nnodes. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative\\\\nvalues mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and\\\\nsummed. This activity is referred to as a linear combination. Finally, an\\\\nactivation function controls the amplitude of the output. For example, an\\\\nacceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and\\\\n1.\\\\n\\\\nThese artificial networks may be used for predictive modeling, adaptive\\\\ncontrol and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-\\\\nlearning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive\\\\nconclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.[2]\\\\n\\\\n## Overview[edit]\\\\n\\\\nA biological neural network is composed of a group of chemically connected or\\\\nfunctionally associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many\\\\nother neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may\\\\nbe extensive. Connections, called synapses, are usually formed from axons to\\\\ndendrites, though dendrodendritic synapses[3] and other connections are\\\\npossible. Apart from electrical signalling, there are other forms of\\\\nsignalling that arise from neurotransmitter diffusion.\\\\n\\\\nArtificial intelligence, cognitive modelling, and neural networks are\\\\ninformation processing paradigms inspired by how biological neural systems\\\\nprocess data. Artificial intelligence and cognitive modelling try to simulate\\\\nsome properties of biological neural networks. In the artificial intelligence\\\\nfield, artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to speech\\\\nrecognition, image analysis and adaptive control, in order to construct\\\\nsoftware agents (in computer and video games) or autonomous robots.\\\\n\\\\nHistorically, digital computers evolved from the von Neumann model, and\\\\noperate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a\\\\nnumber of processors. On the other hand, the origins of neural networks are\\\\nbased on efforts to model information processing in biological systems. Unlike\\\\nthe von Neumann model, neural network computing does not separate memory and\\\\nprocessing.\\\\n\\\\nNeural network theory has served to identify better how the neurons in the\\\\nbrain function and provide the basis for efforts to create artificial\\\\nintelligence.\\\\n\\\\n## History[edit]\\\\n\\\\nThe preliminary theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was\\\\nindependently proposed by Alexander Bain[4] (1873) and William James[5]\\\\n(1890). In their work, both thoughts and body activity resulted from\\\\ninteractions among neurons within the brain.\\\\n\\\\nComputer simulation of the branching architecture of the dendrites of\\\\npyramidal neurons.[6]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network'})].\\n            If the relevant documents are not useful, you can ignore them.\\n            --- \\n            Here are the relevant insights that we gathered from our interview questions and answers: [{'question': 'Can you explain the concept of neural networks and how they mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks are computational models inspired by the brain's network of neurons, designed to recognize patterns and make decisions.

The output layer produces the final prediction or classification, synthesizing the feature extraction and transformations performed by the preceding layers.'}, {'question': 'How do neural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks learn from training data by adjusting the weights of their connections to minimize the difference between their predicted output and the actual target values.

They combine computer science and statistics to solve complex problems in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). \\n\\n## Mimicking Biological Neurons\\n\\nNeural networks mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another. They consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that are organized into layers. The layers include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each artificial neuron is connected to others and has an associated weight and threshold. \\n\\nWhen an input is received, the artificial neuron performs a calculation by multiplying the input by its weight and summing the results. This calculation is then passed through an activation function, which determines whether the neuron is activated or not. If the output exceeds a specified threshold, the neuron is activated and sends data to the next layer. Otherwise, no data is passed along.\\n\\n## Structure of Neural Networks\\n\\nThe structure of neural networks plays a crucial role in their functioning. The input layer receives raw data, which is then processed and refined through the hidden layers. Each hidden layer performs a series of transformations on the input data using weighted connections and activation functions. Finally, the output layer produces the network's prediction or classification based on the refined information from the preceding layers.\\n\\n## Training for Improved Accuracy\\n\\nNeural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time. During the training process, the network adjusts the weights of its connections to minimize the difference between its predicted output and the actual target values. This adjustment is done through an iterative process called backpropagation, which calculates the error and updates the weights accordingly. With each iteration or epoch, the network learns from the training data and refines its performance.\\n\\n## Applications in Computer Science and AI\\n\\nNeural networks have a wide range of applications in various fields of computer science and AI. In computer vision, they are used for tasks such as object detection, image recognition, and facial recognition. In natural language processing, neural networks power machine translation services, chatbots, and sentiment analysis. They also play a crucial role in autonomous vehicles for navigation and control.

Most of\\\\ntoday’s neural nets are organized into layers of nodes, and they’re “feed-\\\\nforward,” meaning that data moves through them in only one direction. An\\\\nindividual node might be connected to several nodes in the layer beneath it,\\\\nfrom which it receives data, and several nodes in the layer above it, to which\\\\nit sends data.\\\\n\\\\nTo each of its incoming connections, a node will assign a number known as a\\\\n“weight.” When the network is active, the node receives a different data item\\\\n— a different number — over each of its connections and multiplies it by the\\\\nassociated weight. It then adds the resulting products together, yielding a\\\\nsingle number. If that number is below a threshold value, the node passes no\\\\ndata to the next layer. If the number exceeds the threshold value, the node\\\\n“fires,” which in today’s neural nets generally means sending the number — the\\\\nsum of the weighted inputs — along all its outgoing connections.\\\\n\\\\nWhen a neural net is being trained, all of its weights and thresholds are\\\\ninitially set to random values. Training data is fed to the bottom layer — the\\\\ninput layer — and it passes through the succeeding layers, getting multiplied\\\\nand added together in complex ways, until it finally arrives, radically\\\\ntransformed, at the output layer. During training, the weights and thresholds\\\\nare continually adjusted until training data with the same labels consistently\\\\nyield similar outputs.\\\\n\\\\n **Minds and machines**\\\\n\\\\nThe neural nets described by McCullough and Pitts in 1944 had thresholds and\\\\nweights, but they weren’t arranged into layers, and the researchers didn’t\\\\nspecify any training mechanism. What McCullough and Pitts showed was that a\\\\nneural net could, in principle, compute any function that a digital computer\\\\ncould. The result was more neuroscience than computer science: The point was\\\\nto suggest that the human brain could be thought of as a computing device.\\\\n\\\\nNeural nets continue to be a valuable tool for neuroscientific research. For\\\\ninstance, particular network layouts or rules for adjusting weights and\\\\nthresholds have reproduced observed features of human neuroanatomy and\\\\ncognition, an indication that they capture something about how the brain\\\\nprocesses information.\\\\n\\\\nThe first trainable neural network, the Perceptron, was demonstrated by the\\\\nCornell University psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. The Perceptron’s\\\\ndesign was much like that of the modern neural net, except that it had only\\\\none layer with adjustable weights and thresholds, sandwiched between input and\\\\noutput layers.\\\\n\\\\nPerceptrons were an active area of research in both psychology and the\\\\nfledgling discipline of computer science until 1959, when Minsky and Papert\\\\npublished a book titled “Perceptrons,” which demonstrated that executing\\\\ncertain fairly common computations on Perceptrons would be impractically time\\\\nconsuming.\\\\n\\\\n“Of course, all of these limitations kind of disappear if you take machinery\\\\nthat is a little more complicated — like, two layers,” Poggio says. But at the\\\\ntime, the book had a chilling effect on neural-net research.', metadata={'source': 'https://news.mit.edu/2017/explained-neural-networks-deep-learning-0414'}), Document(page_content='Although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial\\\\nneural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what\\\\nhas been learned by a biological neural network. Moreover, recent emphasis on\\\\nthe explainability of AI has contributed towards the development of methods,\\\\nnotably those based on attention mechanisms, for visualizing and explaining\\\\nlearned neural networks. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring\\\\nlearning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic\\\\nprinciples that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, Bengio\\\\nand LeCun (2007) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning, as\\\\nwell as shallow vs deep architecture.[44]\\\\n\\\\nSome other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models (combining neural\\\\nnetworks and symbolic approaches). They advocate the intermix of these two\\\\napproaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of\\\\nthe human mind (Sun and Bookman, 1990).[ _full citation needed_ ]\\\\n\\\\n## Recent improvements[edit]\\\\n\\\\nWhile initially research had been concerned mostly with the electrical\\\\ncharacteristics of neurons, a particularly important part of the investigation\\\\nin recent years has been the exploration of the role of neuromodulators such\\\\nas dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin on behaviour and learning.[\\\\n_citation needed_ ]\\\\n\\\\nBiophysical models, such as BCM theory, have been important in understanding\\\\nmechanisms for synaptic plasticity, and have had applications in both computer\\\\nscience and neuroscience.

More recent efforts show promise for\\\\ncreating nanodevices for very large scale principal components analyses and\\\\nconvolution.[45] If successful, these efforts could usher in a new era of\\\\nneural computing that is a step beyond digital computing,[46] because it\\\\ndepends on learning rather than programming and because it is fundamentally\\\\nanalog rather than digital even though the first instantiations may in fact be\\\\nwith CMOS digital devices.\\\\n\\\\nBetween 2009 and 2012, the recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward\\\\nneural networks developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the\\\\nSwiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern\\\\nrecognition and machine learning.[47] For example, multi-dimensional long\\\\nshort term memory (LSTM)[48][49] won three competitions in connected\\\\nhandwriting recognition at the 2009 International Conference on Document\\\\nAnalysis and Recognition (ICDAR), without any prior knowledge about the three\\\\ndifferent languages to be learned.\\\\n\\\\nVariants of the back-propagation algorithm, as well as unsupervised methods by\\\\nGeoff Hinton and colleagues at the University of Toronto, can be used to train\\\\ndeep, highly nonlinear neural architectures,[50] similar to the 1980\\\\nNeocognitron by Kunihiko Fukushima,[51] and the \\\"standard architecture of\\\\nvision\\\",[52] inspired by the simple and complex cells identified by David H.\\\\nHubel and Torsten Wiesel in the primary visual cortex.\\\\n\\\\nRadial basis function and wavelet networks have also been introduced.

They are comprised of an input\\\\nlayer, a hidden layer or layers, and an output layer. While these neural\\\\nnetworks are also commonly referred to as MLPs, it’s important to note that\\\\nthey are actually comprised of sigmoid neurons, not perceptrons, as most real-\\\\nworld problems are nonlinear. Data usually is fed into these models to train\\\\nthem, and they are the foundation for computer vision, natural language\\\\nprocessing, and other neural networks.\\\\n\\\\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are similar to feedforward networks, but\\\\nthey’re usually utilized for image recognition, pattern recognition, and/or\\\\ncomputer vision. These networks harness principles from linear algebra,\\\\nparticularly matrix multiplication, to identify patterns within an image.\\\\n\\\\nRecurrent neural networks (RNNs) are identified by their feedback loops. These\\\\nlearning algorithms are primarily leveraged when using time-series data to\\\\nmake predictions about future outcomes, such as stock market predictions or\\\\nsales forecasting.\\\\n\\\\n##  \\\\n\\\\n##  Neural networks vs. deep learning\\\\n\\\\nDeep Learning and neural networks tend to be used interchangeably in\\\\nconversation, which can be confusing. As a result, it’s worth noting that the\\\\n“deep” in deep learning is just referring to the depth of layers in a neural\\\\nnetwork. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would\\\\nbe inclusive of the inputs and the output—can be considered a deep learning\\\\nalgorithm.

Self-\\\\nlearning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive\\\\nconclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.[2]\\\\n\\\\n## Overview[edit]\\\\n\\\\nA biological neural network is composed of a group of chemically connected or\\\\nfunctionally associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many\\\\nother neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may\\\\nbe extensive.

Neural networks rely on training data to learn and adjust their weights, which are essential for their functioning.\\n\\nHere are the key steps involved in training neural networks for improved accuracy:\\n\\n1. **Data Preparation**: Before training a neural network, it is crucial to prepare the training data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the input features. Proper data preparation ensures that the network can learn meaningful patterns from the data.\\n\\n2. **Defining the Network Architecture**: The network architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, needs to be defined. This architecture depends on the complexity of the problem and the available data. A well-designed network architecture can lead to better accuracy.\\n\\n3. **Initializing Weights**: The weights of the connections between neurons are initialized randomly. Proper initialization is essential to avoid the problem of the network getting stuck in local minima during training.\\n\\n4. **Forward Propagation**: During the training process, the network takes the input data and performs forward propagation.

They combine computer science and statistics to solve complex problems in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). \\n\\n## Mimicking Biological Neurons\\n\\nNeural networks mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another. They consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that are organized into layers. The layers include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each artificial neuron is connected to others and has an associated weight and threshold. \\n\\nWhen an input is received, the artificial neuron performs a calculation by multiplying the input by its weight and summing the results. This calculation is then passed through an activation function, which determines whether the neuron is activated or not. If the output exceeds a specified threshold, the neuron is activated and sends data to the next layer. Otherwise, no data is passed along.\\n\\n## Structure of Neural Networks\\n\\nThe structure of neural networks plays a crucial role in their functioning. The input layer receives raw data, which is then processed and refined through the hidden layers. Each hidden layer performs a series of transformations on the input data using weighted connections and activation functions. Finally, the output layer produces the network's prediction or classification based on the refined information from the preceding layers.\\n\\n## Training for Improved Accuracy\\n\\nNeural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time. During the training process, the network adjusts the weights of its connections to minimize the difference between its predicted output and the actual target values. This adjustment is done through an iterative process called backpropagation, which calculates the error and updates the weights accordingly. With each iteration or epoch, the network learns from the training data and refines its performance.\\n\\n## Applications in Computer Science and AI\\n\\nNeural networks have a wide range of applications in various fields of computer science and AI. In computer vision, they are used for tasks such as object detection, image recognition, and facial recognition. In natural language processing, neural networks power machine translation services, chatbots, and sentiment analysis. They also play a crucial role in autonomous vehicles for navigation and control. In healthcare, neural networks assist in diagnosing diseases through medical imaging.\\n\\n## Key Milestones in the History of Neural Networks\\n\\nThe development of neural networks has seen several key milestones that have shaped their capabilities and applications. Some notable milestones include:\\n\\n- 1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduce a mathematical model of a neuron, laying the groundwork for neural networks.\\n- 1958: Frank Rosenblatt invents the Perceptron, an early neural network model that could learn simple tasks.\\n- 1986: Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams introduce backpropagation, significantly improving the training of multi-layer neural networks.\\n- 1990s: The vanishing gradient problem is identified, hindering the training of deep neural networks.\\n- Early 2000s: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) revolutionize computer vision tasks.\\n- 2012: AlexNet, a deep CNN, wins the ImageNet competition, reinvigorating interest in neural networks.\\n- 2014-2016: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks become popular for sequence-based tasks like natural language processing.\\n- 2015: Residual Networks (ResNets) introduced, allowing for the training of even deeper networks.\\n- 2018-2021: Transformers and attention mechanisms become the state-of-the-art architecture for various tasks in machine learning and AI.\\n- Ongoing: Research continues in areas like generative models, reinforcement learning, and explainability, expanding the capabilities and applications of neural networks.\\n\\nThe continuous advancements in neural networks contribute to their increasing impact and potential in solving complex problems and advancing AI technologies.\\n\\nIn conclusion, neural networks are powerful computational models that mimic the functioning of the human brain. They have a layered structure and rely on training data to improve their accuracy. Neural networks have a wide range of applications in computer science and AI, and their development has seen significant milestones that have shaped their capabilities over time.\\nAI: # Understanding the Structure of Neural Networks\\n\\nNeural networks are computational models that mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another. They consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, organized into layers. Understanding the structure of neural networks is essential to grasp how they function.\\n\\n## Layers in a Neural Network\\n\\nA typical neural network consists of three main types of layers: the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. Each layer plays a specific role in the network's information processing.\\n\\n1. **Input Layer**: The input layer receives raw data and passes it to the hidden layers for further processing. It acts as the entry point for information into the network.\\n\\n2. **Hidden Layers**: The hidden layers are responsible for refining and transforming the input data through a series of weighted connections and activation functions. These layers perform complex calculations to extract meaningful features from the input.\\n\\n3. **Output Layer**: The output layer produces the final prediction or classification based on the refined information from the preceding layers. It synthesizes the extracted features to generate the desired output.\\n\\nThe number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer can vary depending on the complexity of the problem being solved. Deeper networks with more layers can capture more intricate relationships but may require more computational resources for training.\\n\\n## Weights and Connections\\n\\nNeurons in a neural network are connected to other neurons through weighted connections. Each connection has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection. During the network's training process, these weights are adjusted to optimize the network's performance.\\n\\nWhen an input is received, each neuron performs a calculation by multiplying the input by its weight and summing the results. This calculation is then passed through an activation function, which determines whether the neuron is activated or not. If the output exceeds a specified threshold, the neuron is activated and sends data to the next layer. Otherwise, no data is passed along.\\n\\n## Training and Learning\\n\\nNeural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time. The training process involves adjusting the weights of the connections to minimize the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual target values. This adjustment is done through an iterative process called backpropagation, which calculates the error and updates the weights accordingly.\\n\\nDuring training, the network learns from the training data and refines its performance with each iteration or epoch. The goal is to optimize the network's weights to make accurate predictions or classifications when presented with new, unseen data.\\n\\n## Applying Neural Networks\\n\\nNeural networks have a wide range of applications in computer science and artificial intelligence. In computer vision, they are used for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition. In natural language processing, neural networks power machine translation services, chatbots, and sentiment analysis. They are also crucial in autonomous vehicles for navigation and control.

They advocate the intermix of these two\\\\napproaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of\\\\nthe human mind (Sun and Bookman, 1990).[ _full citation needed_ ]\\\\n\\\\n## Recent improvements[edit]\\\\n\\\\nWhile initially research had been concerned mostly with the electrical\\\\ncharacteristics of neurons, a particularly important part of the investigation\\\\nin recent years has been the exploration of the role of neuromodulators such\\\\nas dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin on behaviour and learning.[\\\\n_citation needed_ ]\\\\n\\\\nBiophysical models, such as BCM theory, have been important in understanding\\\\nmechanisms for synaptic plasticity, and have had applications in both computer\\\\nscience and neuroscience. Research is ongoing in understanding the\\\\ncomputational algorithms used in the brain, with some recent biological\\\\nevidence for radial basis networks and neural backpropagation as mechanisms\\\\nfor processing data.[ _citation needed_ ]\\\\n\\\\nComputational devices have been created in CMOS for both biophysical\\\\nsimulation and neuromorphic computing. More recent efforts show promise for\\\\ncreating nanodevices for very large scale principal components analyses and\\\\nconvolution.[45] If successful, these efforts could usher in a new era of\\\\nneural computing that is a step beyond digital computing,[46] because it\\\\ndepends on learning rather than programming and because it is fundamentally\\\\nanalog rather than digital even though the first instantiations may in fact be\\\\nwith CMOS digital devices.\\\\n\\\\nBetween 2009 and 2012, the recurrent neural networks and deep feedforward\\\\nneural networks developed in the research group of Jürgen Schmidhuber at the\\\\nSwiss AI Lab IDSIA have won eight international competitions in pattern\\\\nrecognition and machine learning.[47] For example, multi-dimensional long\\\\nshort term memory (LSTM)[48][49] won three competitions in connected\\\\nhandwriting recognition at the 2009 International Conference on Document\\\\nAnalysis and Recognition (ICDAR), without any prior knowledge about the three\\\\ndifferent languages to be learned.\\\\n\\\\nVariants of the back-propagation algorithm, as well as unsupervised methods by\\\\nGeoff Hinton and colleagues at the University of Toronto, can be used to train\\\\ndeep, highly nonlinear neural architectures,[50] similar to the 1980\\\\nNeocognitron by Kunihiko Fukushima,[51] and the \\\"standard architecture of\\\\nvision\\\",[52] inspired by the simple and complex cells identified by David H.\\\\nHubel and Torsten Wiesel in the primary visual cortex.\\\\n\\\\nRadial basis function and wavelet networks have also been introduced. These\\\\ncan be shown to offer best approximation properties and have been applied in\\\\nnonlinear system identification and classification applications.[37]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network'})].\\n            If the relevant documents are not useful, you can ignore them.\\n            --- \\n            Here are the relevant insights that we gathered from our interview questions and answers: [{'question': 'Can you explain the concept of neural networks and how they mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks are computational models inspired by the brain's network of neurons, designed to recognize patterns and make decisions.

They combine computer science and statistics to solve complex problems in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). \\n\\n## Mimicking Biological Neurons\\n\\nNeural networks mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another. They consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, that are organized into layers. The layers include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each artificial neuron is connected to others and has an associated weight and threshold. \\n\\nWhen an input is received, the artificial neuron performs a calculation by multiplying the input by its weight and summing the results. This calculation is then passed through an activation function, which determines whether the neuron is activated or not. If the output exceeds a specified threshold, the neuron is activated and sends data to the next layer. Otherwise, no data is passed along.\\n\\n## Structure of Neural Networks\\n\\nThe structure of neural networks plays a crucial role in their functioning.

They consist of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons, organized into layers. Understanding the structure of neural networks is essential to grasp how they function.\\n\\n## Layers in a Neural Network\\n\\nA typical neural network consists of three main types of layers: the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. Each layer plays a specific role in the network's information processing.\\n\\n1. **Input Layer**: The input layer receives raw data and passes it to the hidden layers for further processing. It acts as the entry point for information into the network.\\n\\n2. **Hidden Layers**: The hidden layers are responsible for refining and transforming the input data through a series of weighted connections and activation functions. These layers perform complex calculations to extract meaningful features from the input.\\n\\n3. **Output Layer**: The output layer produces the final prediction or classification based on the refined information from the preceding layers. It synthesizes the extracted features to generate the desired output.\\n\\nThe number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer can vary depending on the complexity of the problem being solved. Deeper networks with more layers can capture more intricate relationships but may require more computational resources for training.\\n\\n## Weights and Connections\\n\\nNeurons in a neural network are connected to other neurons through weighted connections. Each connection has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection. During the network's training process, these weights are adjusted to optimize the network's performance.\\n\\nWhen an input is received, each neuron performs a calculation by multiplying the input by its weight and summing the results. This calculation is then passed through an activation function, which determines whether the neuron is activated or not. If the output exceeds a specified threshold, the neuron is activated and sends data to the next layer. Otherwise, no data is passed along.\\n\\n## Training and Learning\\n\\nNeural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time. The training process involves adjusting the weights of the connections to minimize the difference between the network's predicted output and the actual target values. This adjustment is done through an iterative process called backpropagation, which calculates the error and updates the weights accordingly.\\n\\nDuring training, the network learns from the training data and refines its performance with each iteration or epoch. The goal is to optimize the network's weights to make accurate predictions or classifications when presented with new, unseen data.\\n\\n## Applying Neural Networks\\n\\nNeural networks have a wide range of applications in computer science and artificial intelligence. In computer vision, they are used for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition. In natural language processing, neural networks power machine translation services, chatbots, and sentiment analysis. They are also crucial in autonomous vehicles for navigation and control. Furthermore, neural networks assist in diagnosing diseases through medical imaging in the healthcare domain.\\n\\nUnderstanding the structure of neural networks and how they process information is fundamental to harnessing their power in solving complex problems and advancing AI technologies.\\nAI: # Training Neural Networks for Improved Accuracy\\n\\nTraining neural networks is a fundamental step in improving their accuracy and enabling them to make more accurate predictions or classifications. Neural networks rely on training data to learn and adjust their weights, which are essential for their functioning.\\n\\nHere are the key steps involved in training neural networks for improved accuracy:\\n\\n1. **Data Preparation**: Before training a neural network, it is crucial to prepare the training data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and normalizing the input features. Proper data preparation ensures that the network can learn meaningful patterns from the data.\\n\\n2. **Defining the Network Architecture**: The network architecture, including the number of layers and neurons, needs to be defined. This architecture depends on the complexity of the problem and the available data. A well-designed network architecture can lead to better accuracy.\\n\\n3. **Initializing Weights**: The weights of the connections between neurons are initialized randomly. Proper initialization is essential to avoid the problem of the network getting stuck in local minima during training.\\n\\n4. **Forward Propagation**: During the training process, the network takes the input data and performs forward propagation. This involves passing the data through the layers, applying weighted calculations, and activation functions to produce an output.\\n\\n5. **Calculating the Error**: After forward propagation, the network compares the predicted output with the actual target values. The difference between the predicted and target values is the error or loss. The choice of the loss function depends on the specific task.\\n\\n6. **Backpropagation**: Backpropagation is a crucial step in training neural networks. It involves propagating the error backward through the network, adjusting the weights of the connections based on the error. This process helps the network learn from its mistakes and improve its predictions.\\n\\n7. **Gradient Descent**: To update the weights during backpropagation, gradient descent is used. Gradient descent calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and adjusts the weights in the direction that minimizes the loss. This iterative process continues until the network converges to a point of minimum loss.\\n\\n8. **Epochs and Batch Size**: Training neural networks typically involves multiple iterations over the entire training dataset, known as epochs. Each epoch consists of passing the training data through the network, adjusting the weights, and updating the model. The batch size determines the number of training examples processed in each iteration.\\n\\n9. **Validation and Testing**: After training, the network's performance is evaluated on validation and testing datasets. This helps assess the generalization ability of the network and identify any overfitting or underfitting issues. Fine-tuning and hyperparameter adjustments may be necessary based on the evaluation results.\\n\\nBy following these steps and continuously iterating on the training process, neural networks can achieve improved accuracy over time. The iterative nature of training allows the network to learn from the training data and refine its predictions or classifications.\\n\\nInsights:\\n\\n- Neural networks learn from training data by adjusting the weights of their connections to minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.\\n- The training process involves forward propagation, calculating the error, backpropagation, and updating weights using gradient descent.\\n- Proper data preparation, network architecture, and hyperparameter tuning are crucial for training neural networks.\\n- Validation and testing are essential to evaluate the network's performance and ensure its ability to generalize to unseen data.\\n\\nIncluding these insights will enhance the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the blog post on neural networks.\\nAI: # Applications of Neural Networks in Computer Science and AI\\n\\nNeural networks have a wide range of applications in various fields of computer science and artificial intelligence.

In their work, both thoughts and body activity resulted from\\\\ninteractions among neurons within the brain.\\\\n\\\\nComputer simulation of the branching architecture of the dendrites of\\\\npyramidal neurons.[6]\\\\n\\\\nFor Bain,[4] every activity led to the firing of a certain set of neurons.\\\\nWhen activities were repeated, the connections between those neurons\\\\nstrengthened. According to his theory, this repetition was what led to the\\\\nformation of memory. The general scientific community at the time was\\\\nskeptical of Bain's[4] theory because it required what appeared to be an\\\\ninordinate number of neural connections within the brain. It is now apparent\\\\nthat the brain is exceedingly complex and that the same brain “wiring” can\\\\nhandle multiple problems and inputs.\\\\n\\\\nJames'[5] theory was similar to Bain's,[4] however, he suggested that memories\\\\nand actions resulted from electrical currents flowing among the neurons in the\\\\nbrain. His model, by focusing on the flow of electrical currents, did not\\\\nrequire individual neural connections for each memory or action.\\\\n\\\\nC. S. Sherrington[7] (1898) conducted experiments to test James' theory. He\\\\nran electrical currents down the spinal cords of rats. However, instead of\\\\ndemonstrating an increase in electrical current as projected by James,\\\\nSherrington found that the electrical current strength decreased as the\\\\ntesting continued over time. Importantly, this work led to the discovery of\\\\nthe concept of habituation.\\\\n\\\\nWilhelm Lenz (1920) and Ernst Ising (1925) created and analyzed the Ising\\\\nmodel[8] which is essentially a non-learning artificial recurrent neural\\\\nnetwork (RNN) consisting of neuron-like threshold elements.[9] In 1972,\\\\nShun'ichi Amari made this architecture adaptive.[10][9] His learning RNN was\\\\npopularised by John Hopfield in 1982.[11] McCulloch and Pitts[12] (1943) also\\\\ncreated a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and\\\\nalgorithms. They called this model threshold logic. These early models paved\\\\nthe way for neural network research to split into two distinct approaches. One\\\\napproach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on\\\\nthe application of neural networks to artificial intelligence.\\\\n\\\\nIn the late 1940s psychologist Donald Hebb[13] created a hypothesis of\\\\nlearning based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that is now known as\\\\nHebbian learning.

In most cases, an ANN is an adaptive system that\\\\nchanges its structure based on external or internal information that flows\\\\nthrough the network.\\\\n\\\\nIn more practical terms neural networks are non-linear statistical data\\\\nmodeling or decision making tools. They can be used to model complex\\\\nrelationships between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data.\\\\n\\\\nAn artificial neural network involves a network of simple processing elements\\\\n(artificial neurons) which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by\\\\nthe connections between the processing elements and element parameters.\\\\nArtificial neurons were first proposed in 1943 by Warren McCulloch, a\\\\nneurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, who first collaborated at the\\\\nUniversity of Chicago.[35]\\\\n\\\\nOne classical type of artificial neural network is the recurrent Hopfield\\\\nnetwork.\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by Alan\\\\nTuring in his 1948 paper _Intelligent Machinery_ in which he called them\\\\n\\\"B-type unorganised machines\\\".[36]', metadata={'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network'})].\\n            If the relevant documents are not useful, you can ignore them.\\n            --- \\n            Here are the relevant insights that we gathered from our interview questions and answers: [{'question': 'Can you explain the concept of neural networks and how they mimic the way biological neurons signal to one another?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks are computational models inspired by the brain's network of neurons, designed to recognize patterns and make decisions. In both biological neurons and artificial neural units, an incoming signal is processed and passed on to connected units if it exceeds a certain threshold. The strength of the connections, known as weights, can be adjusted in the learning process to improve the network's performance.\\\"}, {'question': 'What are the different layers in a neural network and how do they contribute to its functioning?', 'answer': 'A typical neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the raw data and passes it to the hidden layers, where each layer progressively refines the information through a series of weighted connections and activation functions. The output layer produces the final prediction or classification, synthesizing the feature extraction and transformations performed by the preceding layers.'}, {'question': 'How do neural networks rely on training data to improve their accuracy over time?', 'answer': \\\"Neural networks learn from training data by adjusting the weights of their connections to minimize the difference between their predicted output and the actual target values. During training, each pass through the entire dataset, known as an epoch, refines these weights based on a loss function that measures the error. Over time, this iterative process improves the network's performance, enabling it to make more accurate predictions or classifications.\\\"}, {'question': 'Can you provide examples of the applications of neural networks in computer science and artificial intelligence?', 'answer': 'Certainly! In computer vision, neural networks are used for tasks like object detection and facial recognition. In natural language processing, they power machine translation services and chatbots. Neural networks are also critical in autonomous vehicles for navigation, and in healthcare, they assist in diagnosing diseases through medical imaging.'}, {'question': 'What are some key milestones in the history of neural networks and their development?', 'answer': '1943: Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduce a mathematical model of a neuron, laying the groundwork for neural networks. 1958: Frank Rosenblatt invents the Perceptron, an early neural network model that could learn simple tasks. 1986: Rumelhart, Hinton, and Williams introduce backpropagation, significantly improving the training of multi-layer neural networks. 1990s: The vanishing gradient problem is identified, hindering the training of deep neural networks.

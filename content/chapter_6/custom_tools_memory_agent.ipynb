      "      \"text\": \"20\\nPokémon Trading Card Game RulesFull details of attacking\\nFor most attacks, the order in which you do things doesn’t really matter. However, for a complicated attack, here are the full steps:\\nA) Look at your Pokémon and decide which attack to use. Make sure you have the correct Energy attached.  \\nThen, announce you are using that attack.\\nB) Apply any effects that might alter or cancel the attack. For example, if an attack that was used against your Pokémon  \\nlast turn says, “If the Defending Pokémon tries to attack during your opponent’s next turn, your opponent flips a coin.  \\nIf tails, that attack doesn’t happen.” (But remember—if an Active Pokémon moves to the Bench, all effects of attacks  \\ngo away. So if your Active Pokémon has changed since your opponent used the attack in this example, you don’t have  \\nto flip a coin.)\\nC) If your Active Pokémon is Confused, check now to see if its attack doesn’t happen.\\nD) Make any choices the attack requires you to make. For example, if an attack says, “Choose 1 of your opponent’s  \\nBenched Pokémon,” you would make that choice now.\\nE) Do anything the attack requires you to do to use it. For example, you must flip a coin if an attack says “Flip a coin.  \\nIf tails, this attack does nothing.”\\nF) Apply any effects that happen before damage, then place damage counters, and then do all other effects.\\nFiguring out how many damage counters to place is usually straightforward. However, if many things are changing the damage,  \\nfollow these steps in this order:\\n1) Start with the base damage printed to the right of the attack. If an ×, –, or + is printed next to it, the attack text will  \\ntell you how much damage to do. If an attack tells you to put damage counters on a Pokémon, you have no more  \\ncalculations to do because damage counters aren’t affected by Weakness, Resistance, or any other effects on a \\nPokémon. Just put those damage counters on the affected Pokémon!\\n2) Figure out damage effects on your Active Pokémon based on Trainer cards or any other relevant effects. For example,  \\nif your Pokémon used an attack last turn that said, “During your next turn, this Pokémon’s attacks do 40 more damage \\n(before applying Weakness and Resistance),” then add that in. Stop if the base damage is 0 (or if the attack does not do \\nany damage at all). Otherwise, keep going.\\n3) Increase the damage by the amount next to your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s Weakness, if it has Weakness to your  \\nActive Pokémon’s type.\\n4) Reduce the damage by the amount next to your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s Resistance, if it has Resistance to your  \\nActive Pokémon’s type.\\n5) Figure out damage effects of Trainer or Energy cards, or other effects on your opponent’s Active Pokémon. For example,  \\nif your opponent’s Active Pokémon has an Ability that says “This Pokémon takes 20 less damage from attacks  \\n(after applying Weakness and Resistance).”\\n6) For each 10 damage of the final attack, put 1 damage counter on the affected Pokémon. If the damage is 0 or less,  \\ndon’t put on any damage counters!\"\n",

(The exception is drawing cards: you can choose 0 for an effect that says “draw up to X \\ncards.”) If a card uses the phrase “any amount” or “any number”—for example, “discard any amount of Energy from this Pokémon”— \\nyou can choose 0. And things that say “you may” are optional, meaning you can choose not to do them.\\nWhat if you should draw more cards than you have?\\nIf a card tells you to draw or look at more cards from your deck than you have left, draw or look at the cards you have and \\ncontinue play as normal. \\nFor example, if a card tells you to draw or look at the top 5 cards of your deck and you have only 3 cards left in your deck,  \\ndraw or look at those 3. You lose if you cannot draw a card at the beginning of your turn, but not if you cannot draw one  \\nbecause a card told you to do so. \\nWhat if both players win at the same time?\\nYou win if you take your last Prize card or if your opponent has no Benched Pokémon to replace their Active Pokémon if it  \\nis Knocked Out (or otherwise removed from play). This makes it possible for both players to win at the same time.\\nIf this happens, play Sudden Death. However, if you win in both ways and your opponent wins in only one way, you are the victor!\\nWhat’s Sudden Death?\\nIn Sudden Death, you play a new game, but each player uses only 1 Prize card instead of the usual 6. Except for the single  \\nPrize card, treat the Sudden Death game like a whole new game! Flip a coin to see who goes first and set everything up as usual. \\nThe winner of this game is the overall winner. If the Sudden Death game also ends in Sudden Death, just keep playing Sudden \\nDeath games until somebody wins.\\nWhat does and doesn’t count for a Pokémon’s name?\\nSome Pokémon cards have extra information after their name, such as a Level or a symbol like . A Pokémon’s name changes how \\nyou can evolve or play certain cards. Level is not part of a Pokémon’s name:\\n • Gengar, Gengar LV. 43, Gengar LV. 44, and Gengar LV. X all have the same name \\nSymbols at the end of a Pokémon’s name are  part of a Pokémon’s name:\\n • Alakazam, Alakazam , and Alakazam h all have different names from each other\\n • However, δ (Delta Species) is not part of a Pokémon’s name. Aerodactyl and Aerodactyl δ (Delta Species) have the same \\nname\\nAn owner or form name in a Pokémon’s name is part of the Pokémon’s name:\\n • Meowth, Alolan Meowth, and Rocket’s Meowth have different names\\nWhen you are building a deck, you can have only 4 copies of a card with the same name in it, except for Basic Energy cards.  \\nIf your deck has 1 each of Gengar, Gengar LV.43, Gengar LV. 44, and Gengar LV. X, you can’t put any more cards named Gengar  \\nin your deck! However, you could have 4 Meowth, 4 Alolan Meowth, and 4 Rocket’s Meowth.\\nWhen evolving, the “evolves from” Pokémon name must match the Pokémon being evolved.

Remember to keep it at exactly 60 cards! \\nIf you’re starting a whole new deck, though, try these guidelines for starters:\\n • Pick one or two Energy types at most. Remember, most  Pokémon can use any Energy for attacks, so they can go  \\nin nearly any deck!\\n • To make sure you have enough Energy cards, try between 12 and 15 in your 60-card deck.\\n • Trainer cards are important, too. Cards like Nest Ball and Jacq can help you find exactly the cards you need! Around 20  \\nto 25 Trainer cards is a good start.\\n • Of course, you need Pokémon! The rest of your deck will be Pokémon. Remember, you need at least one Basic Pokémon  \\nin your deck. Collect your favorite Pokémon so you can have 4 copies of them in your deck to make sure you draw them \\nas much as possible.

Once you do, Omastar works just like any other Stage 1 Pokémon— \\nput it on top of Omanyte when you could normally play a Stage 1 Pokémon.\\nKey Restored Pokémon Notes\\n • If you have a Restored Pokémon in your hand, you cannot play it to your Bench unless you play an Item card and its effect tells you to.\\n • Restored Pokémon are not Basic Pokémon! Thus, you cannot play them as your Active or Benched Pokémon during setup.  \\nAlso, you must still have at least one Basic Pokémon in your deck if you otherwise only have Restored Pokémon in your deck.  \\nFinally, Restored Pokémon are not Evolution cards.\\n • Cards or effects that refer to “Basic,” “Stage 1,” “Stage 2,” or “Evolution” cards don’t affect Restored Pokémon. For example, a card that says  \\n“Search your deck for a Basic Pokémon” can’t find this Restored Omanyte card. However, one that says “Search your deck for a Pokémon”  \\ncan find Omanyte. Also, cards that affect unevolved Pokémon will affect Restored Pokémon.\\n • When playing with older Fossil Pokémon, the most important rules to follow are the“Evolves from” or “Put this card into play…” text.  \\nFor example, Kabuto was printed in XY—Fates Collide as a Restored Pokémon, along with a Stage 1 Kabutops that evolves from it. \\nRegardless of which Kabuto you have in play, you can evolve it into any Kabutops that says “Evolves from Kabuto.” This means you  \\ncan evolve a Stage 2 Kabutops from a Restored Kabuto or a Stage 1 Kabutops from a Stage 1 Kabuto.\"\n",

However, for a complicated attack, here are the full steps:\\nA) Look at your Pokémon and decide which attack to use. Make sure you have the correct Energy attached.  \\nThen, announce you are using that attack.\\nB) Apply any effects that might alter or cancel the attack. For example, if an attack that was used against your Pokémon  \\nlast turn says, “If the Defending Pokémon tries to attack during your opponent’s next turn, your opponent flips a coin.  \\nIf tails, that attack doesn’t happen.” (But remember—if an Active Pokémon moves to the Bench, all effects of attacks  \\ngo away. So if your Active Pokémon has changed since your opponent used the attack in this example, you don’t have  \\nto flip a coin.)\\nC) If your Active Pokémon is Confused, check now to see if its attack doesn’t happen.\\nD) Make any choices the attack requires you to make. For example, if an attack says, “Choose 1 of your opponent’s  \\nBenched Pokémon,” you would make that choice now.\\nE) Do anything the attack requires you to do to use it. For example, you must flip a coin if an attack says “Flip a coin.  \\nIf tails, this attack does nothing.”\\nF) Apply any effects that happen before damage, then place damage counters, and then do all other effects.\\nFiguring out how many damage counters to place is usually straightforward. However, if many things are changing the damage,  \\nfollow these steps in this order:\\n1) Start with the base damage printed to the right of the attack. If an ×, –, or + is printed next to it, the attack text will  \\ntell you how much damage to do. If an attack tells you to put damage counters on a Pokémon, you have no more  \\ncalculations to do because damage counters aren’t affected by Weakness, Resistance, or any other effects on a \\nPokémon. Just put those damage counters on the affected Pokémon!\\n2) Figure out damage effects on your Active Pokémon based on Trainer cards or any other relevant effects. For example,  \\nif your Pokémon used an attack last turn that said, “During your next turn, this Pokémon’s attacks do 40 more damage \\n(before applying Weakness and Resistance),” then add that in. Stop if the base damage is 0 (or if the attack does not do \\nany damage at all). Otherwise, keep going.\\n3) Increase the damage by the amount next to your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s Weakness, if it has Weakness to your  \\nActive Pokémon’s type.\\n4) Reduce the damage by the amount next to your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s Resistance, if it has Resistance to your  \\nActive Pokémon’s type.\\n5) Figure out damage effects of Trainer or Energy cards, or other effects on your opponent’s Active Pokémon. For example,  \\nif your opponent’s Active Pokémon has an Ability that says “This Pokémon takes 20 less damage from attacks  \\n(after applying Weakness and Resistance).”\\n6) For each 10 damage of the final attack, put 1 damage counter on the affected Pokémon. If the damage is 0 or less,  \\ndon’t put on any damage counters!\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",

(The exception is drawing cards: you can choose 0 for an effect that says “draw up to X \\ncards.”) If a card uses the phrase “any amount” or “any number”—for example, “discard any amount of Energy from this Pokémon”— \\nyou can choose 0. And things that say “you may” are optional, meaning you can choose not to do them.\\nWhat if you should draw more cards than you have?\\nIf a card tells you to draw or look at more cards from your deck than you have left, draw or look at the cards you have and \\ncontinue play as normal. \\nFor example, if a card tells you to draw or look at the top 5 cards of your deck and you have only 3 cards left in your deck,  \\ndraw or look at those 3. You lose if you cannot draw a card at the beginning of your turn, but not if you cannot draw one  \\nbecause a card told you to do so. \\nWhat if both players win at the same time?\\nYou win if you take your last Prize card or if your opponent has no Benched Pokémon to replace their Active Pokémon if it  \\nis Knocked Out (or otherwise removed from play). This makes it possible for both players to win at the same time.\\nIf this happens, play Sudden Death. However, if you win in both ways and your opponent wins in only one way, you are the victor!\\nWhat’s Sudden Death?\\nIn Sudden Death, you play a new game, but each player uses only 1 Prize card instead of the usual 6. Except for the single  \\nPrize card, treat the Sudden Death game like a whole new game! Flip a coin to see who goes first and set everything up as usual. \\nThe winner of this game is the overall winner. If the Sudden Death game also ends in Sudden Death, just keep playing Sudden \\nDeath games until somebody wins.\\nWhat does and doesn’t count for a Pokémon’s name?\\nSome Pokémon cards have extra information after their name, such as a Level or a symbol like . A Pokémon’s name changes how \\nyou can evolve or play certain cards. Level is not part of a Pokémon’s name:\\n • Gengar, Gengar LV. 43, Gengar LV. 44, and Gengar LV. X all have the same name \\nSymbols at the end of a Pokémon’s name are  part of a Pokémon’s name:\\n • Alakazam, Alakazam , and Alakazam h all have different names from each other\\n • However, δ (Delta Species) is not part of a Pokémon’s name. Aerodactyl and Aerodactyl δ (Delta Species) have the same \\nname\\nAn owner or form name in a Pokémon’s name is part of the Pokémon’s name:\\n • Meowth, Alolan Meowth, and Rocket’s Meowth have different names\\nWhen you are building a deck, you can have only 4 copies of a card with the same name in it, except for Basic Energy cards.  \\nIf your deck has 1 each of Gengar, Gengar LV.43, Gengar LV. 44, and Gengar LV. X, you can’t put any more cards named Gengar  \\nin your deck! However, you could have 4 Meowth, 4 Alolan Meowth, and 4 Rocket’s Meowth.\\nWhen evolving, the “evolves from” Pokémon name must match the Pokémon being evolved. So Graveler can evolve from Geodude, \\nor Geodude LV. 12, but not Brock’s Geodude.\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",

One of the most important rules is that your deck must be exactly  \\n60 cards; it can’t be any more or less, even 59 or 61 cards!\\nAlso, except for Basic Energy, you can only have 4 cards with the same name in your deck. This means you can have only 4 cards \\ncalled “Pignite” in your deck, even if they all have different attacks. Finally, your deck must have at least one Basic Pokémon in it.\\nBuilding your own deck can be challenging, but also a lot of fun. A League Leader at a Pokémon League can help you with  \\nsome ideas. Another good idea is to find an ex Battle Deck you like and try modifying it. Remember to keep it at exactly 60 cards! \\nIf you’re starting a whole new deck, though, try these guidelines for starters:\\n • Pick one or two Energy types at most. Remember, most  Pokémon can use any Energy for attacks, so they can go  \\nin nearly any deck!\\n • To make sure you have enough Energy cards, try between 12 and 15 in your 60-card deck.\\n • Trainer cards are important, too. Cards like Nest Ball and Jacq can help you find exactly the cards you need! Around 20  \\nto 25 Trainer cards is a good start.\\n • Of course, you need Pokémon! The rest of your deck will be Pokémon. Remember, you need at least one Basic Pokémon  \\nin your deck. Collect your favorite Pokémon so you can have 4 copies of them in your deck to make sure you draw them \\nas much as possible. And, if that Pokémon evolves, try to get 4 of each Pokémon in its Evolution chain as well!\\nEvery deck is different and will fit your personality and personal strategy. Over time you’ll find the numbers of Pokémon, Trainer, \\nand Energy cards you like the best.\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",

Therefore, you can only have \\nfour total cards named Mewtwo V-UNION in your deck, not four  \\nof each individual piece. All four copies of a Pokémon V-UNION  \\nin your deck must be part of the same set and illustrated by  \\nthe same artist.\\nYou must play all four pieces of a Pokémon V-UNION onto your  \\nBench at the same time from your discard pile. You can’t play just  \\none or two pieces of the Pokémon V-UNION. A Pokémon V-UNION  \\nonly takes up one Bench spot and can only have one Pokémon Tool \\nattached. Each Pokémon V-UNION may only be played once per  \\ngame, per Pokémon name. You can play a Mewtwo V-UNION and  \\nthen a Greninja V-UNION, but not Mewtwo V-UNION a second time.\\nPokémon V-UNION are not Basic Pokémon! Thus, you cannot play  \\nthem as your Active or Benched Pokémon during setup. Also,  \\nyou must include at least one Basic Pokémon in your deck if you  \\nonly have Pokémon V-UNION in it so far. Finally, Pokémon V-UNION  \\nare not Evolution cards. Pokémon V-UNION have their own unique  \\nStage called V-UNION.\\nCards or effects that refer to “Basic,” “Stage 1,” “Stage 2,” or “Evolution” \\ncards don’t affect Pokémon V-UNION. For example, an Ability that  \\nsays “Your opponent’s Basic Pokémon cannot attack” will not affect \\nMewtwo V-UNION. Also, cards that affect “unevolved Pokémon” will  \\naffect Pokémon V-UNION.\\nWhen a Pokémon V-UNION is in play, the set of four cards is treated as  \\none card. When those cards are anywhere else (in your hand, your deck,  \\nyour discard pile, or as your Prize cards), each card is treated as one separate card. For example, if a card tells you to “search your \\ndeck for a Pokémon and put it into your hand” and you have three pieces of Mewtwo V-UNION in your deck, you may only put one \\nof those three pieces into your hand. \\nThe only characteristics that can be referenced on an individual piece are “types” (Water, Psychic, etc.), “Category” (Pokémon),  \\nand “Card Name.” If you play a card that says, “Search your deck for a  Pokémon,” you could grab any of the four pieces of a \\nPsychic-type Pokémon V-UNION, since each piece has the  type printed on it. Characteristics such as attacks, Abilities, HP, \\nRetreat Cost, Weakness, or Resistance cannot be referenced to any individual card piece. This means that if you play a card that \\nsays, “Search your deck for a Pokémon with a Retreat Cost of 3 or more,” you will not be able to grab any Pokémon V-UNION \\npieces, even if the combined card has a Retreat Cost of 3 or more while in play.\\nPokémon V-UNION are still considered “Pokémon V” and fall into the category of “Pokémon with a Rule Box” while in play since \\nthey have the V-UNION rule and give up 3 Prize cards when Knocked Out. If a Stadium in play removes Abilities from Pokémon \\nwith a Rule Box, then your Pokémon V-UNION will be affected and no longer have access to any of its Abilities while in play.  \\nWhen not in play, individual Pokémon V-UNION pieces are not considered “Pokémon with a Rule Box.”\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",

Also,  \\nwhen 1 of your Pokémon becomes a Mega Evolution \\nPokémon, your turn ends. Make sure you’ve done \\neverything else you want to do on your turn before  \\nyou play one of these powerful Pokémon!\\nNote that Primal Reversion Pokémon work just like  \\nMega Evolution Pokémon, so the same rules apply!Notice that Mega Venusaur-EX evolves from Venusaur-EX.  \\nThis means you can only evolve Mega Venusaur-EX from  \\nVenusaur-EX, not Venusaur!

As you can see, Omanyte is a Restored Pokémon,  \\nand has the rule “ Put this card on your Bench only with the effect of Helix Fossil Omanyte. ” This means exactly what it says:  \\nthe only way to play Omanyte to your Bench is to play the Helix Fossil Omanyte Item card. If you look at Helix Fossil Omanyte, \\nyou’ll see exactly how you can get Omanyte into play. Once you do, Omastar works just like any other Stage 1 Pokémon— \\nput it on top of Omanyte when you could normally play a Stage 1 Pokémon.\\nKey Restored Pokémon Notes\\n • If you have a Restored Pokémon in your hand, you cannot play it to your Bench unless you play an Item card and its effect tells you to.\\n • Restored Pokémon are not Basic Pokémon! Thus, you cannot play them as your Active or Benched Pokémon during setup.  \\nAlso, you must still have at least one Basic Pokémon in your deck if you otherwise only have Restored Pokémon in your deck.  \\nFinally, Restored Pokémon are not Evolution cards.\\n • Cards or effects that refer to “Basic,” “Stage 1,” “Stage 2,” or “Evolution” cards don’t affect Restored Pokémon. For example, a card that says  \\n“Search your deck for a Basic Pokémon” can’t find this Restored Omanyte card. However, one that says “Search your deck for a Pokémon”  \\ncan find Omanyte. Also, cards that affect unevolved Pokémon will affect Restored Pokémon.\\n • When playing with older Fossil Pokémon, the most important rules to follow are the“Evolves from” or “Put this card into play…” text.  \\nFor example, Kabuto was printed in XY—Fates Collide as a Restored Pokémon, along with a Stage 1 Kabutops that evolves from it. \\nRegardless of which Kabuto you have in play, you can evolve it into any Kabutops that says “Evolves from Kabuto.” This means you  \\ncan evolve a Stage 2 Kabutops from a Restored Kabuto or a Stage 1 Kabutops from a Stage 1 Kabuto.\\\"\\n\\n\\nCONCISE SUMMARY:\"\n",

      "    \"Human: Write a concise summary of the following:\\n\\n\\n\\\"The summary of the \\\"Pokémon Trading Card Game Rules\\\" is not provided.\\n\\nThis document contains the rules and guidelines for playing the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It includes information on various types of Pokémon cards, special rules for different card types, gameplay mechanics, and deck building. It also includes appendices with additional details on specific game elements and terminology.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game is a strategy-based game where players use collectible cards to customize their gameplay. The goal is to battle and defeat opponents' Pokémon to win Prize cards. Players can start with a pre-made deck or build their own by collecting cards. The game revolves around being a Pokémon Trainer and battling other trainers with powerful Pokémon creatures.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has 11 Energy types, each with different powers and abilities. These types include Grass, Fire, Water, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, Lightning, Psychic, Colorless, Dragon, and Fairy. Fairy-type Pokémon are not included in the Scarlet & Violet Series, but they exist in older expansions. Each type has unique characteristics and strategies, such as healing, inflicting status conditions, manipulating energy, resisting attacks, and having strong attacks.\\n\\nThe given text provides a brief overview of the parts of a Pokémon trading card, including the card name, stage, trainer type, collector card number, expansion code, Pokémon type, trainer rule, text box, and HP (hit points).\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game consists of three types of cards: Pokémon, Energy, and Trainer cards. Pokémon cards are the most important and can be Basic Pokémon, Stage 1 Pokémon, or Stage 2 Pokémon. Energy cards are needed for Pokémon to attack, and any type of Energy can be used. Trainer cards represent items, supporters, stadiums, and Pokémon tools that can be used in battle.\\n\\nThe summary explains the different zones in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, including the Active Spot, Bench, Hand, Deck, Prize Cards, and Discard Pile. It also mentions the rules for each zone and how they are used during gameplay.\\n\\nThe summary provides a brief overview of the rules for playing the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It explains the three ways to win the game, the setup process, and the placement of cards on the playing field.\\n\\nIn a turn of the Pokémon Trading Card Game, players must draw a card, take various actions such as evolving their Pokémon or attaching energy cards, and then attack before ending their turn.\\n\\nThe summary is about the basic actions and rules in the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It mentions that the player should start their turn by drawing a card. They can then choose to put Basic Pokémon cards from their hand onto their Bench. The Bench can hold up to 5 Pokémon.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game allows players to evolve their Pokémon by playing cards that indicate they evolve from a previously played Pokémon. Evolving a Pokémon allows it to keep attached cards and any damage counters, while ending any effects or conditions. Players can also attach Energy cards to their Pokémon once per turn. There are restrictions on evolving Pokémon on the first turn and evolving a Pokémon multiple times in one turn. An example is given to illustrate the concept.\\n\\nThe summary states that in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, players can play Trainer cards, such as Item and Pokémon Tool cards. Supporter cards can be played like Item cards, but only one can be played per turn. The player going first cannot play a Supporter card on their first turn. Stadium cards have special rules, including only one Stadium being allowed in play at a time. Players can retreat their active Pokémon once per turn by discarding energy, and can switch it with a Pokémon from the bench. Abilities can be used by Pokémon, and players can still attack after using an Ability.\\n\\nThe text provides information about two attacks in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, Rain Splash and Spiral Kick. Rain Splash requires 1 Energy and does 20 damage, while Spiral Kick requires 3 Energy (including 1 specific type) and does 70 damage. The player must have the right amount and type of Energy attached to their Pokémon to use these attacks. The attacking process has three steps, and once the attack is made, the player's turn is over. Sandaconda's Sandstorm Spray attack requires 3 Energy and 1 Energy of any type. Some attacks have a  symbol, indicating that they can be used without any Energy attached.\\n\\nThis section of the Pokémon Trading Card Game rules explains how to check the weakness and resistance of your opponent's active Pokémon, how to apply damage counters during attacks, and what happens when a Pokémon is knocked out. It also mentions that the player whose Pokémon was knocked out chooses a new active Pokémon from their bench, and that the turn is over after these actions are completed.\\n\\nDuring the Pokémon Trading Card Game, there is a special step called Pokémon Checkup that occurs between turns. Special Conditions, such as being poisoned, burned, asleep, or paralyzed, are addressed during this step. The effects of Abilities, Trainer cards, and other card instructions are also applied during Pokémon Checkup. If a Pokémon has no remaining HP, it is Knocked Out, and the player must bring in a new Pokémon. Special Conditions can only affect the Active Pokémon, and they are removed when the Pokémon goes to the Bench or evolves. Asleep Pokémon cannot attack or retreat, and a coin is flipped during Pokémon Checkup to determine if it recovers or remains asleep. Burned Pokémon receive damage counters and have a coin flipped to determine if they recover or not. Burn markers cannot be stacked, and they should look different from damage counters.\\n\\nThe summary of the given information is as follows: \\n\\n- When a Pokémon is Poisoned, a Poison marker is placed on it and a damage counter is added during the Pokémon Checkup.\\n- Pokémon cannot have two Poison markers; if another Poison marker is added, it replaces the old one.\\n- Special Conditions are removed when a Pokémon evolves or moves to the Bench, except for Asleep and Paralyzed which prevent retreating.\\n- The last Special Condition that occurred is the only one that remains in effect.\\n- Poisoned and Burned use markers and do not affect other Special Conditions.\\n- Some Abilities or Trainer cards may have effects during Pokémon Checkup or between turns.\\n- A Paralyzed Pokémon cannot attack or retreat but recovers during Pokémon Checkup after its owner's next turn.\\n- A Confused Pokémon must flip a coin before attacking, and if tails, the attack doesn't happen and damage counters are added.\\n\\nThe summary is about the Pokémon Trading Card Game rules and the option to get an ex Battle Deck to help learn how to play the game. It also mentions the opportunity to earn prizes and battle against other players. It suggests asking a local store about Pokémon Leagues or finding one nearby on the official Pokémon website.\\n\\nIf either player does not have a Basic Pokémon in their opening hand in the Pokémon Trading Card Game, they must take a mulligan. If both players have no Basic Pokémon, they start over. If only one player has no Basic Pokémon, they announce a mulligan and reshuffle their hand until they have a Basic Pokémon. The other player may draw extra cards for each additional mulligan taken. Once both players have Basic Pokémon, the game begins.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has specific rules for what counts as an attack. Every attack has a cost, name, and may have base damage and damage text. Attacks can include actions that don't cause damage. Abilities and other actions are not considered attacks.\\n\\nThe summary states the steps to follow when performing a complicated attack in the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It includes checking for any effects that may alter or cancel the attack, considering the choice and actions required by the attack, and calculating the damage based on various factors such as weakness, resistance, and additional effects. The summary emphasizes the importance of following the specific order of steps outlined.\\n\\nThis document provides clarification on certain rules and scenarios in the Pokémon Trading Card Game. It explains the difference between \\\"up to\\\" and \\\"any amount\\\" in terms of choosing numbers for card effects. It also explains what happens if a player needs to draw more cards than they have left in their deck. The document also addresses the possibility of both players winning at the same time and introduces the concept of Sudden Death to determine the overall winner. Additionally, it explains the rules regarding a Pokémon's name, including the inclusion of levels and symbols. Lastly, it mentions the limitations on card duplication in a deck and the requirement for the \\\"evolves from\\\" Pokémon name to match the Pokémon being evolved.\\n\\nWhen building a Pokémon Trading Card Game deck, it must consist of exactly 60 cards and can only have 4 cards with the same name, except for Basic Energy. The deck must also include at least one Basic Pokémon. It is recommended to consult a League Leader or modify an existing Battle Deck. Guidelines for building a deck include selecting one or two Energy types, including 12 to 15 Energy cards, and 20 to 25 Trainer cards. The rest of the deck should consist of Pokémon, with 4 copies of each favorite Pokémon and their evolution chain. Each deck is unique and should align with personal strategy.\\n\\nThis summary explains that Pokémon ex are powerful Pokémon with more HP and stronger attacks, but if they are knocked out, the opponent takes 2 Prize cards. It also mentions that Pokémon ex and Pokémon-EX have different names, allowing for 4 of each in a deck. Additionally, three Antique Fossils have been rediscovered, which can be played as Basic Pokémon and have unique Abilities. If the opponent knocks out an Antique Fossil, they can take a Prize card.\\n\\nThe Lost Zone is a zone in the Pokémon Trading Card Game where cards that are sent there cannot be recovered or used in the game. Tera Pokémon ex have a special ability that prevents all attack damage done to them while they are on the Bench. When a Tera Pokémon ex is Knocked Out, the opponent takes 2 Prize cards.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has introduced Pokémon VSTAR, which have a unique ability or attack called VSTAR Power. Players can only use one VSTAR Power per game. If a Pokémon VSTAR is knocked out, the opponent takes 2 Prize cards. Shaymin VSTAR can only evolve from Shaymin V, and Pokémon VSTAR are considered a different stage but still count as Pokémon V. Additionally, there are Radiant Pokémon, which have a special shiny coloration and a rule that only allows one Radiant Pokémon per deck. Radiant Pokémon are always Basic Pokémon and do not evolve.\\n\\nThe rules for Pokémon V-UNION state that all four pieces of a Pokémon V-UNION must have the same name and be from the same set and artist. They must be played together onto the Bench from the discard pile and can only have one Pokémon Tool attached. Each Pokémon V-UNION can only be played once per game. Pokémon V-UNION are not Basic Pokémon and cannot be played during setup unless there is at least one Basic Pokémon in the deck. They have their own unique Stage called V-UNION. Cards or effects that refer to Basic, Stage 1, Stage 2, or Evolution cards do not affect Pokémon V-UNION. When in play, the set of four cards is treated as one card, but when not in play, each card is treated separately. Only types, category, and card name can be referenced on an individual piece, while attacks, abilities, HP, retreat cost, weakness, and resistance cannot. Pokémon V-UNION are still considered Pokémon V and give up 3 Prize cards when knocked out. If a Stadium removes abilities from Pokémon with a Rule Box, Pokémon V-UNION will be affected.\\n\\nThis summary provides information on the Pokémon Trading Card Game Rules regarding Pokémon VMAX, Battle Styles, and Pokémon V. Pokémon VMAX are powerful cards with high HP and attacks, but if they are knocked out, the opponent takes 3 Prize cards. Battle Styles introduce Single Strike and Rapid Strike Pokémon with different attack styles, and Fusion Strike Pokémon combine the strengths of both styles. Trainer and Energy cards can also be tagged with Battle Styles. Pokémon V are Basic Pokémon with high HP and strong attacks, but if they are knocked out, the opponent takes 2 Prize cards.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game now includes regional variants, such as Paldean, Hisuian, Galarian, and Alolan Pokémon. These variants have different names and can only evolve from specific Pokémon. Players are allowed to have up to 4 of the same variant in their deck.\\n\\nTAG TEAM is a special kind of Pokémon in the Trading Card Game that consists of multiple Pokémon joining forces to create a powerful team. They have high HP and strong attacks, including a special GX attack that gets a bonus when certain requirements are met. However, if your TAG TEAM Pokémon is knocked out, your opponent gets to take 3 Prize cards. Additionally, there are TAG TEAM Supporter cards that feature two Trainers teaming up, offering special team bonuses when extra cards are discarded. Each TAG TEAM Supporter card has a unique effect.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has introduced Prism Star cards, which are powerful cards that can only be included once in a deck. Unlike other special cards, different Prism Star cards with different names can be included in the same deck. When a Prism Star card would normally go to the discard pile, it goes to the Lost Zone instead. Additionally, the Rare Fossil and Unidentified Fossil Item cards can be played as Basic Pokémon and can evolve into specific Fossil Pokémon.\\n\\nPokémon-GX are powerful cards that can be evolved from other Pokémon and have stronger attacks. When a Pokémon-GX is knocked out, the opponent takes 2 Prize cards. Each Pokémon-GX has a unique GX attack that can only be used once per game. The GX marker is used to keep track of this. Pokémon-GX have special rules, including that they can have up to 4 of each in a deck if desired.\\n\\nThe Pokémon Trading Card Game has introduced Ultra Beasts, which are Pokémon-GX with unique effects and attacks related to Prize cards. There are also dual-type Pokémon that have two types simultaneously, and their attacks are affected by the weaknesses and resistances of both types.\\n\\nBREAK Evolution is a special type of Evolution in the Pokémon Trading Card Game.

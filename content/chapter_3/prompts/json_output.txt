Compose a very detailed article outline on "The benefits of learning code" with a JSON payload structure that highlights key points.

Only return valid JSON.

Here is an example of the JSON structure:
```{
    "Introduction": [
        "a. Explanation of data engineering",
        "b. Importance of data engineering in todayâ€™s data-driven world"],
    "Efficient Data Management": [
        "a. Definition of data management",
        "b. How data engineering helps in efficient data management."],
    "Conclusion": [
        "a. Importance of Data Engineering in the modern business world",
        "b. Future of Data Engineering and its impact on the data ecosystem"]
}
```

       "  Document(page_content='16.4 Ongoing Mark eting Planning and Evaluation\\nLearning Objectiv es\\n1.Apply marketing planning processes to ongoing business settings.\\n2.Identify the role of the marketing audit.\\nOur discussion so far might lead you to believe that a marketing plan is created only when a new of fering is\\nbeing launched. In reality , marketing plans are created frequently—sometimes on an annual basis, or when a new\\nCMO is hired, when market dynamics change drastically and quickly , or just whenever a company’ s CEO wants\\none. Moreover , as we indicated, a marketing plan should be something of a “living” document; it should contain\\ntriggers that result in a company reevaluating its strategies should dif ferent scenarios occur .\\nSome of those scenarios can occur immediately . For example, when a product is launched, the market reacts.\\nJournalists begin to cover the phenomenon, competitors respond, and regulators may take note. What then should\\nhappen if the sales goals for the product are substantially exceeded? Should its price be raised or lowered? Should\\nfollow-on of ferings be launched sooner? What if a competitor launches a similar of fering a week later? Or worse\\nyet, what if the competition launches a much better of fering? The key to a successful ongoing marketing strategy\\nis twofold: understanding causality and good execution of the marketing plan. Next we discuss each of these\\naspects.\\nAudio Clip\\nKatie Scallan-Sarantakes\\nhttp://app.wistia.com/embed/medias/b1db0efe17\\nKatie Scallan-Sarantakes knows firsthand the dif ficulty of tracking the success of marketing activity . She\\ndescribes some of those challenges here.\\nCausality\\nCausality is the relationship between two variables whereby one variable is a direct consequence of the other .\\nFor a scientist in a lab, identifying causality is fairly easy because the causal variable can be controlled and the\\nconsequences observed. For marketers, such control is a dream, not a reality . Identifying causality , then, can be a\\nreal challenge.\\nWhy is causality so important? Assume you’ve observed a drop in sales that you think is caused by a competitor ’s\\nlower price. If you reduce your price to combat the competitor ’s when, in reality , the poor sales are due simply\\nto seasonal factors, lower prices might give consumers the impression that your product is cheap or low quality .\\n482', metadata={'page': 490.0, 'source': '/var/folders/_y/20jl658s4jl0zvy5c0x0c5140000gn/T/tmpr74w14jh/tmp.pdf'})]}"

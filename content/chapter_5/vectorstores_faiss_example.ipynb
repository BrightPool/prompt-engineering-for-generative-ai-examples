This process entails initially retrieving more results than `k`, followed by their filtration. Document filtration can be executed based on metadata. Additionally, you have the option to determine the quantity of documents you wish to fetch prior to filtering by setting the `fetch_k` parameter during any search method invocation. To illustrate, consider the following minor example:\n"
